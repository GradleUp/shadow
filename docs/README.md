Previously this plugin was developed by [@johnrengelman](https://github.com/johnrengelman) and published under the ID [
`com.github.johnrengelman.shadow`](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.johnrengelman.shadow)
before maintenance was transferred to the [GradleUp organization](https://github.com/GradleUp) to ensure future
development, see [#908](https://github.com/GradleUp/shadow/issues/908).

If you are still using the old plugin ID in your build script, we recommend to switch to the new plugin ID [
`com.gradleup.shadow`](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradleup.shadow)
and update to the latest version to receive all the latest bug fixes and improvements.
